## What is Internet of Cars
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the work we build in 2018 Make NTU competition.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We want to build up a system which can connect cars, then we cane freely send information between cars.
For instance, if one car in front of you have one sudden break, the system can send signal to the following cars
which may help them avoid serial car accident.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Plus, we want to set cameras on cars which can obtain information from surroundings such as construction, flood, holes or
accidents, then we collect whole information and display it on the center platform. By so, users can get whole picture of 
the traffic circumstances.
